            Jenkinson's Aquarium is a privately owned facility located on the boardwalk in Point Pleasant Beach, NJ.
    Opening in June of 1991, Jenkinson's Aquarium has proven to be a valuable educational and recreational resource, as evidenced by its growing popularity. The aquarium is dedicated to educating the public on all aspects of marine life and conservation. Each exhibit is designed to promote awareness of the animals, their habitats and conservation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Exhibits such as Atlantic sharks, Pacific sharks, coral reefs, penguins, and seals give you the opportunity to get up close to animals from around the globe. Another attraction, the touch tank, allows visitors to touch live animals ranging from a sea star to a sting ray!
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to the educational exhibits, the aquarium offers workshops for children of all ages, as well as professional development workshops for teachers and group tours for schools and scout groups. Groups are provided a general tour of the building and can choose between a number of Focus Programs that will highlight a chosen topic. If your group is unable to make it to the aquarium, we can come to you through our Outreach Program. If you are looking for somewhere special to have your child’s birthday party, the aquarium is just the place. We offer a Perky the Penguin Birthday Party for children turning four years or older. The aquarium is also available for evening functions such as wedding receptions, corporate parties or business meetings. For those who wish to volunteer their time, Jenkinson’s Aquarium has an extensive volunteer program for those over the age of sixteen. The aquarium staff, including volunteers, participate in many community programs including Adopt-a-Highway and NJ Community Water Watch.
        </p>
        <p>
            The aquarium is open all year for your convenience, closing only on Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s Day.
